# Beetroot pasta recipe

A healthy meal

**Instructions**

-   Preheat your oven to 200°C/fan/220°C/gas 7.
-   Wash the beetroot and remove any dirt and blemishes, then roughly chop into bite-size pieces and put them on a baking tray. Sprinkle with a good pinch of salt and drizzle with a little olive oil. Bake for 20–30 minutes, or until they are well roasted and slightly charred around the edges.
-   Bring a medium saucepan of water to the boil, then add 1 tablespoon of salt and the pasta and cook as per the packet instructions.
-   Put the pine nuts into a dry frying-pan on a high heat and cook for 5minutes, stirring regularly until golden. Remove from the heat and set aside.
-   Drain and rinse the pasta, keeping the pasta water. Put the peas into abowl, pour over the pasta water and leave them sit for 5 minutes. Thendrain and rinse.
-   Peel and chop the garlic and put it into a food processor with the cookedbeets, balsamic vinegar, 150ml of oil and 1 teaspoon of salt, then blenduntil smooth. Add the pine nuts and pulse so they are broken up, but stilla little chunky to give some nice texture.
-   To bring the dish together, put the cooked pasta into a large pan and addhalf the beetroot pesto, half the peas and the rocket. Fold together andwarm on a medium heat for 2–3 minutes, stirring regularly. Keep the restof the pesto for another pasta dish or to use as a fabulous sandwichspread.
-   Divide between 4 bowls and serve with the remaining peas scattered ontop.

**Notes**
Any spare pesto, just keep it for a sandwich spread, which will last for a week in the fridge. You can use ready-cooked beetroot, but the colour will be less vibrant.
